# emf-rbm
Extended Mean Field Restricted Boltzmann Machine

Goal:  to port the julia emf-rbm to python as a sci-kit learn RBM library

Code:  https://github.com/eric-tramel/Boltzmann.jl

##Getting Started

Install Julia and check out the Bolztmann code listed above

Julia will be installed, by default, in

~/.julia

and the Boltzmann RBM package in

~/.julia/v0.4/Boltzmann

We need to run

run `julia mnist_h5.jl`

to generate the sample data sets for the notebook

##Notebook

Just run the notebook; I am current debugging and comparing the result to the julia mnistexample.jl output

##TODO

Testing and Evaluating the RBM

The mnist_h5 data set has been normalized and binarized
