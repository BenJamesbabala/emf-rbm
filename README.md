# emf-rbm
Extended Mean Field Restricted Boltzmann Machine

As described in my blog

https://charlesmartin14.wordpress.com/2016/10/21/improving-rbms-with-physical-chemistry/


This is a port of the julia sphinx emf-rbm 

https://github.com/sphinxteam/Boltzmann.jl

https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5788-training-restricted-boltzmann-machine-via-the-thouless-anderson-palmer-free-energy.pdf

to python, in the style of the scikit learn RBM code.

##Getting Started

Run the notebook EMF_RBM_Test.ipynb

The python class is emf_rbm.py, which can be included in other code

##Other

Other notebooks and julia code are working code used to develop and test the port

Expect this to be cleaned up and organized better as I develop more tests
